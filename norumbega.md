“Under-Mapped Spaces”<br />
<a href="https://library.stanford.edu/rumsey">David Rumsey Map Center</a>, Stanford University, March 2022
</small>

Note: Thanks all for coming to this virtual talk, and thank you to Chloe,
Kelsey, and Riley for inviting me in the first place. Thanks also to Tyler and
the rest of the David Rumsey Map Center staff for making this talk possible.
Thanks also to the McCoy Family Center, Stanford Libraries, Stanford's Department of History, and the Stanford Provost for supporting Chloe, Kelsey, and Riley in implementing Under-Mapped Spaces.

My email and Twitter are here on the first slide, and they will be on the last slide. I don't often share my thoughts with a large audience like this, abut because what I will present is a work in progress, I leave the contact info as a mode by which the conversation can continue. 

Anyway, it's a shame we haven't been able to meet in person, but hopefully my talk and those of my colleagues will reach wider audiences instead.

Finally, I bring you all greetings from lands that have welcomed many peoples
to their shores, including, among others, the Lenape.

“Tierra Nueva”<sup>1</sup>

Note: Bringing up the Lenape makes some sense because the title of this talk, "if England crie out, this Norumbega offreth the Remedie," refers to a place whose name may have roots in an Algonkian language related to the Alkgonkian languages spoken by the Lenape. I'll have more to say about Norumbega as this talk opens up, but for now, suffice it to say that Norumbega is a mystery.

Here it is, styled as Tierra de Nurumberg, in a 1548 map that happens to be in the David Rumsey collection at Stanford Libraries. 

If I succeed with this talk, it will accomplish many things, but the central goal at this second is to build on a project I've been working on for a few years now. That is, I'm very interested in the stories of people who come to America, specifically the United States. These are definitionally stories of settlers who then live on stolen land, but these same settlers are often refugees, "tempest-tossed," in Emma Lazarus's well known words. 

Their stories grab me because they rely on a sense of space that bends and reshapes over the course of their migration and afterward. That is, before their journey, there is an "America" that exists as a geographic and political fact, but there is also the America that exists in their minds as a kind of America-to-come. They have constructed an American imaginary, in short. 
But as this imaginary solidifies, that is, in giving the American image detail, the image of the place they left behind—for whatever reason—also changes. So how do people talk about America before they've migrated there, and how do they talk about the place they left behind once they're in America? And then what if they leave America and return back to that place? 

These two places, America and origin, remain unstable. They are produced and reproduced as the people speak or think or dream. And even as they act, especially with the act of return. 

In the longer version of this talk, then, I consult an archive of novel-like objects (that are mostly just novels) and examine the mutability of their various spatialities, especially along the axis of America and not-America. How, then, can I describe these spatialities? How can I analyze them? Can I map them? What would those maps look like? 

I also look to and reason about the question of when or if these settlers and or refugees become AmericanS. And once they are Americans, do they ever stop being so?

The answers to these questions are preliminary at best, at least without a lot of other work to lead us (or me) to that point, which is why these questions lie in the background of tonight's talk, while I will instead focus on the questions of how to think about what these people say, not about what they say per se.

Cognizant of the theme of "under-mapped spaces," that brings these talks together, I aim to challenge the impulse that makes a mind, and perhaps specifically a Western mind, exercise mastery over a space by mapping it. If we are, as Matthew Edney proposes, moving past the cartographic ideal, which fetishises the map as a representation of reality, toward a focus on mapping as a process, then how do we incorporate fixed moments of mapping in our analyses?

> If Englande crie oute and affirme, that there is so many in all trades that one cannot live for another, as in all places they doe, this Norumbega (if it be thoughte so goodd) offreth the remedie.<sup>1</sup>

Note: The title of this talk closes a text printed in 1584, seemingly with an audience of one: Queen Elizabeth. The text's author never crossed the Atlantic, and the text's reader never did, either. But the text nevertheless describes and develops an American imaginary captured in the name Norumbega. This Norumbega, this America, could

André Thevet and Richard Hakluyt.<sup>1</sup>

Note: The author of the 1584 text, _A Discourse Concerning Western Planting_, is on the right side of this picture, reading a book. That's Richard Hakluyt, a star of tonight's talk. He's in Paris here, around the same time that he is writing the Discourse, in the study of the fellow on the left of the image, André Thevet, who at the time was a court cosmographer and serial plagiariser. Unlike Hakluyt, he _did_ cross the Atlantic, spending a few months as a chaplain in short-lived French settlement in what is now Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. 

Thevet had a knack for collecting accounts of others, compiling them, and publishing them as a narrative of his own travels. In the process of doing so, he acquired lots of information about the Americas as well as the Levant. Hakluyt, sent to Paris to serve in the British embassy as a collector of information concerning these new lands, would have been right at home in Thevet's study, eager to devour all the information therein.

Hakluyt never traveled farther from London than Paris, but he published scores of accounts of travels around the world, not just the Americas. Like the geographer in The Little Prince, Hakluyt stayed in his office and judged the veracity of tales he heard.

> Thus both hearing, and reading the obloquie of our nation and finding few or none of our owne men able to replie heerin… [I] determined notwithstanding all difficulties, to vndertake the burden of that worke wherin all others pretended either ignorance, or lacke of leasure, or want of sufficient argument, whereas (to speake truely) the huge toile, and the small profit to insue, were the chiefe causes of the refusall.<sup>1</sup>

Note: While in France, Hakluyt writes in his main work, the multivolume _Principal Navigations_,of how he read and heard calumnies about English prowess in seafaring, especially in view of their lack of colonies. He chose to undertake the hard work of collecting the stories of English exploratory adventures to the north, west, and east, as he notes here, despite the cost. He was defending queen and country, and casts aspersions on those too lazy to defend their nation with the press. 

As we'll see during the rest of my talk, the press is a vital component to constructing the American Imaginary that Hakluyt promotes. When we first meet him in Jean Dytar's 2018 historical graphic novel _Florida_, he's at a party in the mid 1580s hosted by his friend Sir Walter Raleigh, musing about the name "America." 

<!-- [While in France] I both heard in speech, and read in books other nations miraculously extolled for their discoueries and notable enterprises by sea, but the English of all others for their sluggish security, and continuall neglect of the like attempts especially in so long and happy a time of peace, either ignominiously reported, or exceedingly condemned... -->

Sir Walter Raleigh, Hakluyt, and Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues and his wife Eléonore.<sup>1</sup>

Note: “I often think about this cartographer,” he says here, “who understood, from his tiny studio in Vosges, that the lands found by Columbus weren’t the Indies but were really a new part of the world, which he named ‘America.’” “America” took hold in lieu of “Columbia” (or something similar) because, as Hakluyt explains, “at the beginning of the [16th] century, Amerigo Vespucci was more famous than Columbus owing to the publication of his travel narratives.” At this point, one of the party’s guests, the historical center of the novel, artist Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, intuits Hakluyt’s argument, responding, “What a strange time, where anyone can make a name for themselves because of printing.”

Before moving on, but to demonstrate the path we're taking, I want to underscore the word "cartographe," which here is an anachronism, as the term only emerged in the decades surrounding 1800. The anachronism, though, is a reminder of the touch of the author, whose 21st century hand and own American Imaginary is drawing and writing this text. 

Printing fires the imagination, generates momentum, establishes precedent, and persuades. Hakluyt in his writings gestures at nearly as many motivations for publishing his arguments and collections of narratives as reasons he gives for why England should colonize the Americas (the latter boiling down to 23 reasons). We've already seen that national pride is one, and it may be inextricable from the what seems to be the central, driving impulse: precisely that desire to colonize.

## _Florida_ in Brief

* c. 1552: Guillaume Le Testu meets Eléonore in Dieppe.
* 1564: Jacques joins the Florida expedition as mapmaker.
* 1565: Spanish destroy French colony in Florida.

<hr>

* 1572: St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre. 
* c. 1583: Jacques and Eléonore meet Hakluyt.
* 1588: Jacques dies in London.
* 1591: Theodor De Bry prints Jacques’s Florida narrative.

Note: Now, there is a lot to say about this novel, so I will try to tell the same story, briefly, twice, to advance the novel's challenges to cartography and to the american imaginary. Once from the perspective of Hakluyt and his construction of his American Imaginary, and then once from Le Moyne's sense of America from his having lived there.

Here I split the events in the novel in half. Most of the "current" time of the novel is from 1583 to 1591, and these times are drawn with lots of ink and browns and blues. The flashbacks from before the massacre Dytar paints as watercolors in green and blue. 

---

During the party, Hakluyt begins circling around his main goal in speaking to Le Moyne. He notes that he is leaving for France soon asks Le Moyne if he knows Thevet. Yes, Le Moyne does. Then he pushes the ante, asking if Le Moyne knows where René de Laudonnière lives. Le Moyne is agitated.

Hakluyt needles Le Moyne about Florida.<sup>1</sup>

Note: Once Hakluyt brings up his interest in the failed French colony in Florida, from which Le Moyne barely returned, the panel shatters, and Le Moyne's agitation is buttressed by an image of a flower, the sort of studies of flowers and fruits that made up Le Moyne's career as a painter in London after—despite Dytar's artistic license—fleeing France after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.

In this novel, Dytar mobilizes three distinct graphic styles, which I imagine as three different narrative modes, and we see two here: the regular sepia-toned and heavily inked drawings of the novel's current time, and the studies of nature, shown here in excerpt.

The Le Moynes leave Raleigh’s party.<sup>1</sup>

Note: During dinner, Raleigh takes over for Hakluyt and argues for English colonization in the Americas, and he's eager to get Le Moyne's tale, so that England could avoid the French "failures" ("échecs") in Brazil and Florida. Jacques's flowers fill the text like shards of glass, and he takes Eléonore and the two leave.


<!-- [^first-florida] In 1507, the cartographer in question, Martin Waldseemüller, produced the first European map that showed the lands of the Western Hemisphere as distinct from Asia. The map was, at the same time, the first document to name these lands after Amerigo Vespucci.[^fourth-part-of-the-world] --> 

<!-- Printing fires the imagination, generates momentum, establishes precedent, and persuades. For Hakluyt, the persuasive power of print was crucial. In introducing his multi-volume collection of narratives of English exploration around the globe, _The Principal Navigations_, he remarks on his time in France, facing calumnies regarding English deficiencies in seafaring. Finding "frew or none of our owne men able to replie" to the critiques he heard, he decided to "vndertake the burden of that worke."[@principal-navigations, 4–6] -->

Giovanni da Verrazzano, whose name is affixed to a bridge fewer than 20 miles away from me, apparently found a place named Norumbega, though he never used the word himself, during his visit to this continent in 1524. Instead, it appears for the first time in a map drawn by his brother a few years later. These wheels in motion, the myth of Norumbega grew, a

Note: Doreen Massey begins _For Space_ with a set of ruminations, of failures
of spatial imagination. "Failure in the sense of being inadequate to face up
to the challenges of space; a failure to take on board its coeval
multiplicities, to accept its radical contemporaneity, to deal with its
constitutive complexity. I like the juxtaposition Massey provides here,
between one “map” that tells a story embedded in time, and the other map that
serves only to inform and control.

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Efficacy: Maps are there to be used, especially for navigation
* Discipline: Maps can be incorrect and later corrected
* Publicity: Maps are for wide use
* Morality: Mappers are morally obligated to make the best maps
* Singularity/Universality: there is one map.

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> The normative map must be eliminated, likewise the conviction that it is
meaningful to talk about “maps” or “the map” as a generic category of
phenomena.

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> Map scholars need to study the processes of mapping… Mapping processes are
fluid, the maps they generate are mutable and volatile. Nothing about mapping
is fixed and stable… Map scholars must stop saying “maps are” and instead say
“X mapping is.”

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

In the _West_:

* ? – ~1800: Maps, charts, etc., are all different
* ~1800 – ~1900: All mapping should be “cartography,” unified by projective
  geometry and scale
* ~1900 – ~1970: All mapping *is* “cartography,” even property mapping. “Why
  maps?” is irrelevant.
* ~1970 – present: The ideal is critiqued, yet now more reproduced than ever,
  online.

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Ontology: The map is a reduction of the world/archive.
* Pictorialness: The map is an unmediated/mimetic presentation of the world
* Individuality: Making/using maps are acts of individual cognition
* Materiality: Maps are things in specific moments
* Observation: Maps are grounded in observation and measurement
