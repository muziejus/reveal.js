“Under-Mapped Spaces”<br />
<a href="https://library.stanford.edu/rumsey">David Rumsey Map Center</a>, Stanford University, March 2022
</small>

Note: Thanks all for coming to this virtual talk, and thank you to Chloe,
Kelsey, and Riley for inviting me in the first place. Thanks also to Tyler and
the rest of the David Rumsey Map Center staff for making this talk possible.
Thanks also to the McCoy Family Center, Stanford Libraries, Stanford's Department of History, and the Stanford Provost for supporting Chloe, Kelsey, and Riley in implementing Under-Mapped Spaces.

My email and Twitter are here on the first slide, and they will be on the last slide. I don't often share my thoughts with a large audience like this, abut because what I will present is a work in progress, I leave the contact info as a mode by which the conversation can continue. 

Anyway, it's a shame we haven't been able to meet in person, but hopefully my talk and those of my colleagues will reach wider audiences instead.

Finally, I bring you all greetings from lands that have welcomed many peoples
to their shores, including, among others, the Lenape.

“Tierra Nueva”<sup>1</sup>

Note: Bringing up the Lenape makes some sense because the title of this talk, "if England crie out, this Norumbega offreth the Remedie," refers to a place whose name may have roots in an Algonkian language related to the Alkgonkian languages spoken by the Lenape. I'll have more to say about Norumbega as this talk opens up, but for now, suffice it to say that Norumbega is a mystery.

Here it is, styled as Tierra de Nurumberg, in a 1548 map that happens to be in the David Rumsey collection at Stanford Libraries. 

If I succeed with this talk, it will accomplish many things, but the central goal at this second is to build on a project I've been working on for a few years now. That is, I'm very interested in the stories of people who come to America, specifically the United States. These are definitionally stories of settlers who then live on stolen land, but these same settlers are often refugees, "tempest-tossed," in Emma Lazarus's well known words. 

Their stories grab me because they rely on a sense of space that bends and reshapes over the course of their migration and afterward. That is, before their journey, there is an "America" that exists as a geographic and political fact, but there is also the America that exists in their minds as a kind of America-to-come. They have constructed an American imaginary, in short. 
But as this imaginary solidifies, that is, in giving the American image detail, the image of the place they left behind—for whatever reason—also changes. So how do people talk about America before they've migrated there, and how do they talk about the place they left behind once they're in America? And then what if they leave America and return back to that place? 

These two places, America and origin, remain unstable. They are produced and reproduced as the people speak or think or dream. And even as they act, especially with the act of return. 

In the longer version of this talk, then, I consult an archive of novel-like objects (that are mostly just novels) and examine the mutability of their various spatialities, especially along the axis of America and not-America. How, then, can I describe these spatialities? How can I analyze them? Can I map them? What would those maps look like? 

I also look to and reason about the question of when or if these settlers and or refugees become AmericanS. And once they are Americans, do they ever stop being so?

The answers to these questions are preliminary at best, at least without a lot of other work to lead us (or me) to that point, which is why these questions lie in the background of tonight's talk, while I will instead focus on the questions of how to think about what these people say, not about what they say per se.

Cognizant of the theme of "under-mapped spaces," that brings these talks together, I aim to challenge the impulse that makes a mind, and perhaps specifically a Western mind, exercise mastery over a space by mapping it. If we are, as Matthew Edney proposes, moving past the cartographic ideal, which fetishises the map as a representation of reality, toward a focus on mapping as a process, then how do we incorporate fixed moments of mapping in our analyses?

> If Englande crie oute and affirme, that there is so many in all trades that one cannot live for another, as in all places they doe, this Norumbega (if it be thoughte so goodd) offreth the remedie.<sup>1</sup>

Note: The title of this talk closes a text printed in 1584, seemingly with an audience of one: Queen Elizabeth. The text's author never crossed the Atlantic, and the text's reader never did, either. But the text nevertheless describes and develops an American imaginary captured in the name Norumbega. This Norumbega, this America, could

André Thevet and Richard Hakluyt.<sup>1</sup>

Note: The author of the 1584 text, _A Discourse Concerning Western Planting_, is on the right side of this picture, reading a book. That's Richard Hakluyt, a star of tonight's talk. He's in Paris here, around the same time that he is writing the Discourse, in the study of the fellow on the left of the image, André Thevet, who at the time was a court cosmographer and serial plagiariser. Unlike Hakluyt, he _did_ cross the Atlantic, spending a few months as a chaplain in short-lived French settlement in what is now Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. 

Thevet had a knack for collecting accounts of others, compiling them, and publishing them as a narrative of his own travels. In the process of doing so, he acquired lots of information about the Americas as well as the Levant. Hakluyt, sent to Paris to serve in the British embassy as a collector of information concerning these new lands, would have been right at home in Thevet's study, eager to devour all the information therein.

Hakluyt never traveled farther from London than Paris, but he published scores of accounts of travels around the world, not just the Americas. Like the geographer in The Little Prince, Hakluyt stayed in his office and judged the veracity of tales he heard.

---

> Thus both hearing, and reading the obloquie of our nation and finding few or none of our owne men able to replie heerin… [I] determined notwithstanding all difficulties, to vndertake the burden of that worke wherin all others pretended either ignorance, or lacke of leasure, or want of sufficient argument, whereas (to speake truely) the huge toile, and the small profit to insue, were the chiefe causes of the refusall.<sup>1</sup>

Note: While in France, Hakluyt writes in his main work, the multivolume _Principal Navigations_,of how he read and heard calumnies about English prowess in seafaring, especially in view of their lack of colonies. He chose to undertake the hard work of collecting the stories of English exploratory adventures to the north, west, and east, as he notes here, despite the cost. He was defending queen and country, and casts aspersions on those too lazy to defend their nation with the press. 

As we'll see during the rest of my talk, the press is a vital component to constructing the American Imaginary that Hakluyt promotes. When we first meet him in Jean Dytar's 2018 historical graphic novel _Florida_, he's at a party in the mid 1580s hosted by his friend Sir Walter Raleigh, musing about the name "America." 

<!-- [While in France] I both heard in speech, and read in books other nations miraculously extolled for their discoueries and notable enterprises by sea, but the English of all others for their sluggish security, and continuall neglect of the like attempts especially in so long and happy a time of peace, either ignominiously reported, or exceedingly condemned... -->

Sir Walter Raleigh, Hakluyt, and Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues and his wife Eléonore.<sup>1</sup>

Note: “I often think about this cartographer,” he says here, “who understood, from his tiny studio in Vosges, that the lands found by Columbus weren’t the Indies but were really a new part of the world, which he named ‘America.’” “America” took hold in lieu of “Columbia” (or something similar) because, as Hakluyt explains, “at the beginning of the [16th] century, Amerigo Vespucci was more famous than Columbus owing to the publication of his travel narratives.” At this point, one of the party’s guests, the historical center of the novel, artist Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, intuits Hakluyt’s argument, responding, “What a strange time, where anyone can make a name for themselves because of printing.”

Before moving on, but to demonstrate the path we're taking, I want to underscore the word "cartographe," which here is an anachronism, as the term only emerged in the decades surrounding 1800. The anachronism, though, is a reminder of the touch of the author, whose 21st century hand and own American Imaginary is drawing and writing this text. 

Printing fires the imagination, generates momentum, establishes precedent, and persuades. Hakluyt in his writings gestures at nearly as many motivations for publishing his arguments and collections of narratives as reasons he gives for why England should colonize the Americas (the latter boiling down to 23 reasons). We've already seen that national pride is one, and it may be inextricable from the what seems to be the central, driving impulse: precisely that desire to colonize.

## _Florida_ in Brief

* c. 1552: Guillaume Le Testu meets Eléonore in Dieppe.
* 1564: Jacques joins the Florida expedition as mapmaker.
* 1565: Spanish destroy French colony in Florida.

<hr>

* 1572: St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre. 
* c. 1583: Jacques and Eléonore meet Hakluyt.
* 1588: Jacques dies in London.
* 1591: Theodor De Bry prints Jacques’s Florida narrative.

Note: Now, there is a lot to say about this novel, so I will try to tell the same story, briefly, twice, to advance the novel's challenges to cartography and to the american imaginary. Once from the perspective of Hakluyt and his construction of his American Imaginary, and then once from Le Moyne's sense of America from his having lived there.

This timeline gives a sense of the events shown in the novel. I have split the events in the novel in half. Most of the "current" time of the novel is from 1583 to 1591, and these times are drawn with lots of ink and browns and blues. The flashbacks from before the massacre Dytar paints as watercolors in green and blue.

“We have to take advantage of the power of the press.”<sup>1</sup>

Note: Here is Hakluyt, saying that like Martin Luther and Amerigo Vespucci before him, he and his collaborators need to take advantage of the printing press. Over the course of the novel, Hakluyt's propagandizing mission solidifies. The main events of the novel begin around the time he publishes Diverse Voyages, which is a collection of narratives of exploration. Then he publishes the Discourse Concerning Western Plantings, specifically making the case to Queen Elizabeth and her court for the value in colonizing America or Norumbega. By this point, he is collecting the stories of English exploration that makes up the Principal Navigations. 

Dytar creates a sense of increasing calculation in Hakluyt. When he meets Le Moyne, he casually asks about Florida. By this point in the novel, he is practically hectoring Le Moyne for something he can print to help him convince the crown to finance colonization. 

In this scene, Hakluyt turns cold calculator upon visiting Raleigh. Dytar paints Raleigh as defeated over the bad news coming from Roanoke, but Hakluyt asks if at least there is new art regarding Virginia from the colonist artist John White.

---

<img src="img/florida/174.png" alt="page 174" class="r-stretch">

“Not yet. Not yet. But it will come.”<sup>1</sup>

Note: seeing the new art, Hakluyt responds optimistically. Raleigh counters that these documents don't make common people dream, or his investors, or the court, or the queen herself. These people want gold. They want subdued territory they can exploit. We have nothing of the sort, Raleigh finally declares. And here Dytar shows Hakluyt calmly sipping his drink, knowingly saying "not yet, not yet, but it will come."

Hakluyt's calm in this section underscores how much he values the imaginary he's constructing for the English public as a whole. 

---

<img src="img/florida/178-2.jpg" alt="page 178" class="r-stretch">

“What we must arouse is a great, England-wide debate.”<sup>1</sup>

Note: Now Hakluyt grows animated. John White's images must be seen by as large a public as possible, he argues, and the America in the minds of the English must change from a place of terror and failure and instead become precisely the sort of place the English would eagerly colonize. As a result, the importance of Le Moyne's narrative—and his images—becomes even more central to the project.

<img src="img/florida/190.png" alt="page 190" class="r-stretch">

“We want to promote a new vision of the Americas, based on the Protestant experience.”<sup>1</sup>

Note: To this end, Hakluyt recruits Theodor de Bry, a Protestant printer and engraver who has fled Spanish repression in the low countries and established himself in Frankfurt. Dytar shows De Bry pleading with Le Moyne to help him promote the idea of a Protestant America, shifting the imaginary again from an America colonized by the English to a specifically *Protestant* America colonized by the English and other protestants. After all, both previous French attempts, in Brazil and in Florida, were effectively exercises in creating havens for Huguenots. 

Jacques dies shortly thereafter, and Hakluyt leans on Eléonore to provide him with any material Jacques may have left behind about America. He had, in fact, begun writing a narrative for his daughters before his death, but Dytar shows that the accompanying images are unusable. Eléonore, who grew up surrounded by mapmakers, forges a map of Florida and gives it to Hakluyt along with her husband's text. 

Showing the various conflicts at play, De Bry refuses the package, saying that the images are precisely what made Jacque's story so appealing. First hand drawings that pre-date John White's would make quite a splash on the European market. But calculating Hakluyt has a plan.

<img src="img/florida/226.png" alt="page 226" class="r-stretch">

“I’ve got something even better!”<sup>1</sup>

Note: Here Dytar moves into ground covered in many of his other texts, namely the question of what authorship actually is. De Bry needs pictures for his book. Le Moyne has provided none. De Bry then strikes upon the idea of creating their own images, and Hakluyt suggests using already existing imagery from Thevet's book about Brazil, from John White's drawings, and, worse still, from the Codex Mendoza, which Hakluyt has bought from Thevet. The men will publish an amalgam, inventing new native Americans out of whole cloth. Dytar even provides a visual joke, comparing the pose in one of De Bry's early sketches with the replica of Augustus of Prima Porta on Hakluyt's mantle, drawing upon the trope of the natives as though people descended straight from classical antiquity. 

In the meantime, Hakluyt insists that De Bry show nothing of the grim fate that befell the French in Florida. The images must be inviting and inspiring.

Jacques Le Moyne’s family admires “his” map.<sup>1</sup>

Note: Dytar proposes that the images that accompany Le Moyne's text, when it is published in 1591, are a complete fabrication. A mashup of the details Le Moyne has provided in his text with pictures from Brazil, Mexico, and Virginia. What's more, the map is an invention provided by Eléonore, given verisimilitude by adding toponyms. 

De Bry and Hakluyt have introduced—and, more importantly with its etymological cousin—_pro_duced an America for the European public. De Bry promises to publish the narrative in French, German, and Latin, to ensure a wide readership. Additionally, Hakluyt directs an aesthetic that can affect people who can't read the text. Jacques's family can't read Latin--they rely on his son in law to read the story, but the family crowds around the text to take in the pictures, the traces, allegedly of their father's hand.

> La Pérouse does something that is going to create an enormous difference between the [Ainu] and the European. What is, for the former, a drawing of no importance that the tide may erase, is for the latter the <span style="font-style: normal">single object</span> of his mission.<sup>1</sup>

Note: Bruno Latour tells the story of La Pérouse's tracing the pacific coastline in 1787. Louis 16th has sent the explorer on this mission precisely to create a better map of the area, and La Pérouse asks the local Ainu (Latour calls them "Chinese." The 80s were wild) if the land they are on is an island or a peninsula. An elder draws in the sand a map showing it is an island that we now know as Sakhalin, in Russia, while a younger Ainu hurriedly reproduces the sand drawing in a notebook for the Frenchman. 

Latour's emphasis on the "single object" here resonates with Hakluyt's calculations. He needs images of the Americas in order to build the imaginary. Louis 16th needs maps to build his imaginary of the Pacific and where the Amur River meets the ocean. Latour explains how the map is needed to settle debates, to determine land ownership, to plot commercial travel. But his map must also convince the people back in Versailles. Lapérouse not only polishes an imaginary here, but he also seeks converts to it. 

The instrumentality of Hakluyt's work shows its kinship to Latour's sense of "paper-work." Hakluyt's books are mobile yet immutable yet reproducible and recombinable and annotatable. They not only build images but provide a foundation for future images, for that future of a docile and dominated America ready to quote unquote accept English settlers.

“We must provoke people’s callings, Walter! Arouse their desire!”<sup>1</sup>

Note: In Hakluyt, Dytar levies a critique on the Western practice of constructing imaginaries and assuming them to be representations of reality. We as readers believe Le Moyne is presenting factual information and factual records of the real in America because, I don't know, books don't lie. For Latour, this is part of the lie we Westerners tell ourselves to demonstrate that we are modern, in contrast, say, to the Ainu or the Temecua Le Moyne meets. 

Dytar shows the emptiness behind these facts. The map is drawn by Eléonore. The pictures are photoshops by De Bry under Hakluyt's art direction. The text itself is incomplete when it comes into Hakluyt's hands. Furthermore, Hakluyt makes no pretense of chasing after truth. He is clear that he wants England to establish itself in the Americas, convert the Natives, exploit the raw materials in that Norumbega, and build an empire. And he has the facts for why right here for you to read.

By so troubling the authorship of the map of Florida and thereby troubling also the provenance of De Bry's engravings, Dytar enforces with ink and water color what geographers and people who study maps have known for years. Maps lie.

---

>Geographical maps are embodiments of multifaceted, historical practices among specific humans and nonhumans… Geographical maps can, but need not, be fetishes in the sense of appearing to be nontropic, metaphor-free representations, more or less accurate, of previously existing, “real” properties of a world that are waiting patiently to be plotted. Instead, maps are models of worlds crafted through and for specific practices of intervening and particular ways of life.<sup>1</sup>

Note:

During the party, Hakluyt begins circling around his main goal in speaking to Le Moyne. He notes that he is leaving for France soon asks Le Moyne if he knows Thevet. Yes, Le Moyne does. Then he pushes the ante, asking if Le Moyne knows where René de Laudonnière lives. Le Moyne is agitated.

---

Hakluyt needles Le Moyne about Florida.<sup>1</sup>

Note: Once Hakluyt brings up his interest in the failed French colony in Florida, from which Le Moyne barely returned, the panel shatters, and Le Moyne's agitation is buttressed by an image of a flower, the sort of studies of flowers and fruits that made up Le Moyne's career as a painter in London after—despite Dytar's artistic license—fleeing France after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.

In this novel, Dytar mobilizes three distinct graphic styles, which I imagine as three different narrative modes, and we see two here: the regular sepia-toned and heavily inked drawings of the novel's current time, and the studies of nature, shown here in excerpt.

---

The Le Moynes leave Raleigh’s party.<sup>1</sup>

Note: During dinner, Raleigh takes over for Hakluyt and argues for English colonization in the Americas, and he's eager to get Le Moyne's tale, so that England could avoid the French "failures" ("échecs") in Brazil and Florida. Jacques's flowers fill the text like shards of glass, and he takes Eléonore and the two leave.

between one “map” that tells a story embedded in time, and the other map that
serves only to inform and control.

In the _West_:

* ? – ~1800: Maps, charts, etc., are all different
* ~1800 – ~1900: All mapping should be “cartography,” unified by projective
  geometry and scale
* ~1900 – ~1970: All mapping *is* “cartography,” even property mapping. “Why
  maps?” is irrelevant.
* ~1970 – present: The ideal is critiqued, yet now more reproduced than ever,

* Ontology: The map is a reduction of the world/archive.
