68 To live in the representations of a New World rather than in the New World itself is to inhabit a fluid region, one where the signs by which experience is understood and communicated are as open to mutation, mirroring, and manipulation as they are to objective testing. This might be called the semiotic problem in the history of early exploration: the fact that in this period, the potential dislocation between the experience of a new reality and its subsequent representation in European thought is at a maximum. From a historical point of view, this means that the traditional narrative of who, what, when, and where—the old short route to positive knowledge—must be augmented or even supplanted by a discussion of the stories, maps, accounts, and images—the signs—in which human action is refracted, multiplied, reshaped, and understood. The importance of the fabulous paradise of "Norumbega" is that it can be discovered only in such a discussion.

As David Quinn has shown, Hakluyt's _Divers Voyages_ was put together specifically to promote the New World colonial enterprise of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, which would presumably further England's national goals.

85 For the English, "Norumbega" became the sign that most persuasively and efficiently communicated the attractiveness of settlement in the New World. Its imagined geography and its imagined qualities were reflections of or acceptable displacements for England's own idea of itself. In this, the seminal notion implicit in Verrazzano's account of "Refugio" was fulfilled: that some day Europeans might do more than pass through the New World; they might live in it, own it, and prosper.

In the European mind, the name "Norumbega" subdivided the emerging reality of America and, in the simplest sense, marked the northern corner as "desirable."
